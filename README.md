## [Digit Recognition](</Digit Recognition>)

This notebook is an attempt at solving the [MNIST handwritten digit database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras on top of a Tensorflow backend. The steps I followed are (as described in the [Jupyter Notebook](</Digit Recognition/Digit Recognition.ipynb>)) to do normalization, reshaping, data augmentation and training with an Adam Optimizer and a ReduceLROnPlateau callback. I participated to a competition on a Kaggle and achieved 99.614% accuracy and got 262 position (top 10%) (see [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer)).
